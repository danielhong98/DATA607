###Libraries
library(XML)
library(RCurl)
library(plyr)
library(knitr)
library(RJSONIO)
library(jsonlite)

###Read HTML
htmlurl <-"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielhong98/DATA607/master/books.html"
htmlbooks <- getURL(htmlurl)
htmlbookstable <- readHTMLTable(htmlbooks, header=TRUE)
View(htmlbookstable)

###Read XML - Was getting an error message because in one of the titles there was a "&". Found a workaround on Stackoverflow but could not get it to work so cheated by going to the source file and replacing the symbol with and. Also found the xmlToDataFrame guidance as well.
xmlurl <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielhong98/DATA607/bdb5e8bc25278ee4dff1509b2f32edf77a66a1a3/books.xml")
xmlbooks <- xmlParse(xmlurl)
xmldf <- xmlToDataFrame(xmlbooks)
View(xmldf)

###Read JSON
jsonurl <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/danielhong98/DATA607/2196750caa82fa19f81838a511ecd3930b57cbbe/books.json"
jsonbooks <- fromJSON(jsonurl)
View(jsonbooks)

###In XML format the "&"" symbol could not be recognized like with HTML or JSON, this is the main difference I found by luck. Also I noticed that the headers look a little strange but I did not adjust
